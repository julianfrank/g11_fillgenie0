# Base Mock Site
Build a pure single file HTML Website in index.html with a very complex Banking Loan Application form for new Solar Panels. The form needs to have at least 10 topics with multiple levels in each of the top levels topics. Use jargons not used by regular "layman" people. 
Use all kinds of form elements and make it look like a real form. Use Bootstrap and CSS to make it look good. Use JavaScript to make it interactive. Use react to make it interactive and nanostore for managing the data of the form allowing for the data to be reactively modified with external non react code as well. 

For dev purpose host in bunjs with hono based web framework. 

Add additional pages for admin, demo help and technical overview.

Keep the structure so that it can be directly hosted in github pages as a static site.
